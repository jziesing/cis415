========
project for class to make shell in c using system calls.  Not complete shell, but a example of some system programing in c.  Uploaded to github for personal reference. Not perfect, final version was lost a year ago, just found this version, but this is not the final version.  Will update if I find the old final version or I spend time to fix this.
